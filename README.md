```bash
npm install react-native-img-cache --save
```

## Usage

### CachedImage

The `CachedImage` component assumes that the image URI will never change. The image is stored and served from the application cache.

```jsx
import {CachedImage} from "react-native-img-cache";

<CachedImage source={{ uri: "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/yaqe1qesQ8c/maxresdefault.jpg" }} />
```

The `mutable` property implies assumes that the image URI can change over time. The lifetime of this cache is the one of the running application and it can be manually busted using `ImageCache`.

```jsx
import {CachedImage} from "react-native-img-cache";

<CachedImage source={{ uri: "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/yaqe1qesQ8c/maxresdefault.jpg" }} mutable />
```

Images are stored in the iOS/Android cache folder so you shouldn't have to worry about cleaning this folder yourself.

### ImageCache

#### clear()

Remove cache entries and all physical files.

```js
ImageCache.get().clear();
```

#### bust(uri)

`ImageCache` can be used to bust an image from the local cache.
This removes the cache entry but it **does not remove any physical files**.

```js
ImageCache.get().bust("https://i.ytimg.com/vi/yaqe1qesQ8c/maxresdefault.jpg");
```

#### cancel(uri)

It can also be used to cancel the download of an image. This can be very useful when [scrolling through images](https://medium.com/@wcandillon/image-pipeline-with-react-native-listview-b92d4768b17c).

```js
ImageCache.get().cancel("https://i.ytimg.com/vi/yaqe1qesQ8c/maxresdefault.jpg");
```

#### on(uri, observer, immutable)

The `ImageCache` class can register observers to the cache.

```js
const immutable = true;
const observer = (path: string) => {
    console.log(`path of the image in the cache: ${path}`);
};
ImageCache.get().on(uri, observer, immutable);
```

We use the observer pattern instead of a promise because a mutable image might have different version with different paths in the cache.

#### dispose(uri, observer)

Observers can be deregistered using `dispose`:

```js
ImageCache.get().dispose(uri, observer);
```
